# About us

TechOps helps teams meet the Service Standard, specifically:

[Protect userâ€™s privacy](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/protecting-your-service-against-fraud) - including managing security during the life of the service (responding to threats, applying patches etc), identifying security and privacy threats and carrying out testing.

[Choose the right technology](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/choosing-technology-an-introduction) - including using appropriate tools and technology to build and operate a good service, avoiding lock in, make good decisions over what to build or buy.

[Operate a reliable service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/monitoring-the-status-of-your-service) - including minimising downtime and having a plan to deal with it when it happens.
