## Reliability Engineering

###Â Platforms

Reliability Engineering develops, maintains and supports the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][] and the [GOV.UK PaaS][] infrastructure GDS uses. GDS teams are responsible for the applications and components running on these platforms.

For example, Reliability Engineering is responsible for managing the SSL certificates that handle communications between AWS environments and virtual machines. GDS teams are responsible for managing certificates that protect messages used by their service.

#### Monitoring

Reliability Engineering monitors AWS and the GOV.UK PaaS ensuring their availability. GDS teams must monitor their own applications and respond to alerts.

#### Capacity

Reliability Engineering helps GDS teams manage their capacity until they have the capability to manage their own resources. GDS teams are responsible for performance testing their applications and fixing related problems at code level.

Reliability Engineering holds quarterly meetings, where GDS teams can:

* discuss scaling their environment
* address issues in service performance

For example, if there's an incident that could cause a performance spike, GDS teams should notify Reliability Engineering as soon as possible. This allows Reliability Engineering to make any related changes to a team's environment.
