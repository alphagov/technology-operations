### Remove access to AWS accounts

When someone no longer requires access to AWS (for example, because they've left GDS or your team) remove them from the `gds-users` base account using the **Request user removal** section of the:

[Request an AWS account form](https://gds-request-an-aws-account.cloudapps.digital/).

Before you request someone's removal make sure they do not need access to AWS in another team within GDS.

GDS teams are responsible for managing their own leaversâ€™ process.
