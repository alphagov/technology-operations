## Logging

The Reliability Engineering team uses [Logit](https://logit.io) to provision, manage and ensure availability of your logging infrastructure and provide [ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) stacks.

The Reliability Engineering team helps you integrate Logit into your environment, and create your logging and usage policies.
